Changes that will help me:

- first change to 4-space indenting

- second wrap lines at 70-90 columns

- all internal times should be in milliseconds

- maybe store startedAt in milliseconds rather than a Date object

- some externally-facing times can be in seconds

- onComplete should be an Array of callbacks or a Promise

- should be only loosely coupled to interval for easier pause/resume

- status should be a directly managed value, rather than deduced from
other properties

- auto-start after sdding time should be a parameter to addSeconds,
not a widget-wide preferenece

- turn into jquery ui widget
