Changes that will help me
-------------------------

- rather than getStatus, mode chnages should emit an event that listeners
can react to

- onComplete should be an Array of callbacks or a Promise

- should be only loosely coupled to interval for easier pause/resume

- status should be a directly managed value, rather than deduced from
other properties

- auto-start after adding time should be a parameter to addSeconds,
not a widget-wide preferenece

- enable per-second callbacks
-- e.g. { 57: playTick, 58: playTick, 59: playTick }
